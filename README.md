<h1>First Rails App</h1>

This is my first Rails app. I followed the tutorial found <a href='https://medium.freecodecamp.org/lets-create-an-intermediate-level-ruby-on-rails-application-d7c6e997c63f'>here</a> to build this
application. After parsing through the tutorial and completing that, I will begin to play around with it on my own and add some more functionality. 

This is also my first dive into both Ruby and Sass.
